# C++ Module 03

This module focuses on inheritance in C++, using a hierarchy of robot classes (ClapTrap, ScavTrap, FragTrap, DiamondTrap) and introducing multiple inheritance challenges.

## 🛠️ Usage

For each exercise, navigate to its folder, compile, and run:

📂 ex00

```bash
cd ex00
make
./claptrap
```
📂 ex01

```bash
cd ex01
make
./scavtrap
```

📂 ex02

```bash
cd ex02
make
./fragtrap
```

📂 ex03

```bash
cd ex03
make
./diamondtrap
```

## 📝 Exercise Descriptions
ex00 — Aaaaand... OPEN!:
Implement the ClapTrap class with name, hit points, energy points, and attack damage. Add attack, takeDamage, and beRepaired behaviors.

ex01 — Serena, my love!:
Add the ScavTrap class, inheriting from ClapTrap, with unique messages and a guardGate() ability.

ex02 — Repetitive work:
Add the FragTrap class, also inheriting from ClapTrap, with a highFivesGuys() special function.

ex03 — Now it’s weird!:
Introduce DiamondTrap, using multiple inheritance from both ScavTrap and FragTrap. Add a private name and a whoAmI() function to show its identity.
